# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data in the telecom industry to understand patterns and predict churn rates using machine learning models. The dataset is synthesized to simulate a real-world scenario.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: A script (`create_csv.py`) generates 1,000 synthetic customer records, stored as `telecom_customer_data.csv`.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares features for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes statistical summaries, visualizations (correlation matrix, churn distribution, and pairplots).
- **Model Building**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier are used to predict churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics include classification reports and ROC curves.
- **HTML Report Generation**: Outputs a detailed report with visualizations and evaluation results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Telecom-Churn-Analysis.git
   cd Telecom-Churn-Analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the data generation script:
   ```bash
   python create_csv.py
   ```

4. Perform the analysis and generate the report:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Outputs

1. **Dataset**: `telecom_customer_data.csv` (generated by `create_csv.py`).
2. **Visualizations**:
   - `correlation_matrix.png`
   - `churn_distribution.png`
   - `pairplot.png`
   - `roc_curve.png`
3. **HTML Report**: `report.html` provides an interactive summary of the analysis.

## Highlights

- **Synthetic Data**: Simulates customer churn data with realistic patterns.
- **Automated Workflow**: Handles end-to-end analysis from data generation to report creation.
- **Reproducible Visualizations**: Saves all plots for review and inclusion in reports.

## Example Usage

- **For business analysts**: Understand customer churn patterns and develop strategies to retain customers.
- **For data scientists**: Practice data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization techniques.
- **For educators**: Demonstrate the machine learning pipeline in the context of customer retention.
